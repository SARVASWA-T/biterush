# BiteRush - Complete Food Delivery Platform

Tomato is a robust, multi-tenant food delivery application that links hungry customers, local restaurants, and delivery drivers using real-time sync and dynamic route management. The platform features strict data isolation, role-based access control, and specialized dashboards to ensure a seamless experience for all parties involved exactly when they need it.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-Portal Architecture:** Dedicated interfaces tailored for Customers, Restaurant Owners, Delivery Partners, and System Administrators.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures data isolation so restaurants only manage their own menus/orders, while delivery partners focus entirely on assigned auto-dispatch task lists.
*   **Real-time Order Tracking & Dispatch:** Live tracking of delivery progress via maps, backed by Websockets (`Socket.io`) and ETA calculation services.
*   **Cross-Gateway Payments:** Support for secure checkouts with multi-gateway payments including `Stripe` and `Razorpay`.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Interactive visualized analytics utilizing `Chart.js` for owners and admins to observe sales and performance.
*   **Rate Limiting & Security:** Integrated robust API security implementations like caching with Redis, Rate limiters, and Helmet.

## 🗄️ Database Architecture (MongoDB)

The application uses **MongoDB** as its primary data store, leveraging a well-structured set of schemas to handle high transaction volumes and ensure tenant encapsulation.

### Core Models:
1.  **Users (`userModel`)**: Handles authentication properties, customized settings, and order history for customer accounts.
2.  **Restaurants (`restaurantModel`)**: Represents independent merchant entities, linking their location logic, configuration, and owner permissions.
3.  **Foods (`foodModel`)**: Represents menu items heavily bound to `restaurantModel` to achieve the necessary Multi-tenant Data isolation.
4.  **Orders (`orderModel`)**: Connects Customers, Foods, Restaurants, and Delivery Partners while providing comprehensive state-tracking across the transaction workflow.
5.  **Delivery Partners (`deliveryPartnerModel`)**: Records the driver information, current map coordinates, operational status, and automated dispatch history.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

*(For full execution steps please consult `How To Run Project.pdf` provided in the root directory).*

1. Check out the respective directories (`frontend`, `admin`, `backend`).
2. Run `npm install` inside each to install its particular dependencies.
3. In `backend`, ensure your `.env` lists your MongoDB URI, Redis Config, Stripe/Razorpay keys, and JWT secrets.
4. Run standard local servers using `npm run dev` in UI directories, and `npm run server` starting `backend`.
